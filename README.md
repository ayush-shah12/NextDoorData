# Nextdoor Business Scraper  

## Overview  
This script scrapes business listings from Nextdoor for a given set of city-state pairs and business categories.  
Currently, it retrieves the **top 6 results per city per category** as a temporary solution to see how viable this is for now. Saves to a csv file.
